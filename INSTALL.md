# INSTALL

The grafana-kpi-panel expects to be installed directly under the plugin directory. For instance, in the grafana/grafana docker image, the plugin would be mounted in /var/lib/grafana/plugins/grafana-kpi-panel.

Check the [release](https://github.com/mark-5/grafana-kpi-panel/releases) page for pre compiled tar balls to install.
